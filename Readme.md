# LinkedList in Python

This repository is for fun and learning about a bunch of things:

- Implement a custom `LinkedList` class in Python
- Use Python generics to add (strong) typing to the `LinkedList` implementation
- Use `mypy` for static code analysis

Please note that this code is not production ready.
